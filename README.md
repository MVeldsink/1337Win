# 1337Win
1337win is an automatic injection-based script created for the sole purpose of annoying my co-workers in 1337online.com, if you are the owner of 1337online.com message me and I will remove this from GitHub. It's sole purpose is to click automatically for you on the 13.37.00 minute mark, it has a small delay, so you won't always win.
